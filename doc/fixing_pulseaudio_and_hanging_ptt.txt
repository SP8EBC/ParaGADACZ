In some cases the PTT control might hang just after the PC is started, and the transmitter might stay keyed for 
indefinitely amount of time, probably until a TOT timer will expires and shutdown transmission forcefully. 
This might be caused by FTDI USB to serial port adapter, which has all TTL output pins by default in logic
high state. To fix this it is required to, so called "initialize serial ports". This process is simply
opening the serial port and then closes it immediately. As a result all TTL outputs like RTS/DTR etc. will
be flipped by to logic low state and the transmitter should stay unkeyed. 

This can be done, by systemd service which will use a bash script during startup

[Unit]
Description=Opens and closes immediately all serial port used for PTT

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target


[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/etc/rc.fixusbptt
TimeoutStartSec=0
root@magurka-aprs:/lib/systemd/system# 


and then the script itself 

root@magurka-aprs:/lib/systemd/system# cat /etc/rc.fixusbptt 
#!/bin/bash

/usr/bin/screen -dmS usb1 /dev/ttyUSB1 9600
/usr/bin/screen -dmS usb2 /dev/ttyUSB2 9600
screen -S usb1 -X quit
screen -S usb2 -X quit

If You're using ParaGADACZ along with Svxlink You might get stuck with an issue that Svxlink doesn't see

This is caused by some weirs data races between pulse audio working as system wide service and Svxlink. Probably Pulse
Audio isn't fully ready after startup. Maybe it does some work in background after startup, like configuring sinks 
and sources, loading audio flow and stuff like that. To workaround this problem it is recommended to start Svxlink 
from a systemd timer and delay it for few seconds.
